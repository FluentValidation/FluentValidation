    <PackageReleaseNotes>
Changes in 7.6.103:
* Using [BindProperty] in AspNetCore now works when implicit child validation is disabled.
* ShouldHaveChildValidator now works when the child validator is inside a DependentRules block.
* Test helpers are now compatible with custom property name resolvers set using ValidatorOptions.PropertyNameResolver.
* Switched to embedded debug symbols.

Changes in 7.6.102:
* Fixed a regression where calling ValidateAsync with RuleForEach would no longer execute tasks sequentially (#799).

Changes in 7.6.101:
* Added support for RuleForEach to the testing extensions (#238).
* Fixed a regression where calling ValidateAsync with RuleForEach could cause a deadlock (#799). 
* Added ToString overrides on ValidationResult to generate a string representation of all errors (#778).
* Updated logos thanks to Dylan Beattie (#780).
        
Changes in 7.6.100:
* Resolved an issue where ValidateAsync was called on child validators when the root validator was invoked synchronously.

Changes in 7.6:
* WhenAsync now works correctly when calling the non-async Validate method.
* ASP.NET Core integration has been updated to ASP.NET Core 2.1. 
* Include statement now works when explicitly selecting properties to validate.
* Added Ukranian language support.
* Added Arabic language support.
* Added caching when instantiating validators to obtain clientside metadata.
        
Changes in 7.5.2:
* RuleSet method can now take multiple ruleset names by usinga comma-separated string.
* Make setters on ValidationFailure's properties public to allow for easier deserialization.
* Additional overload for OverridePropertyName that takes an expression.
* Add overload of Include that takes a func to lazily create the inner validator.
* Make error code resolution pluggable using ValidatorOptions.ErrorCodeResolver
        
Changes in 7.5.1:
* Resolved issues with referencing FluentValidation from legacy PCLs.
* Added support for CustomizeValidatorAttribute to the legacy WebApi integration for consistency with MVC5 and AspNetCore.

Changes in 7.5:
* Better handling of clientside messages when using custom overriden language resources
* Added flag in the ValidationContext's RootDataContext when a validator is invoked by the automatic MVC/WebApi integration
* Improvements to some of the validation tester's messages
* Added Transform method to transform property values prior to validation
* Improve support for DisplayAttribute / DisplayNameAttribute when inferring property display name
* New language translations (Slovak/Hebrew/Brazilian Portuguese)
* Cache display names by default 
* Ensure ShouldHaveChildValidator test method works with model-level rules
* Removed netstandard1.0 support. Supported platforms are now netstandard1.1, netstandard2.0 and net45.

Changes in 7.4:
* Improved syntax for DependentRules
* ValidationException serialization support when running on full framework
* Added ComparisonProperty placeholder to some validators
* The Test Helper now correctly handles read-only properties
* Add CancellationToken support to ValidateAndThrowAsync and various ValidateAsync overloads
* Improved functionality for custom MessageBuilders
* Updated AspNetCore integration to MVC version 2.0.2
* Update MVC5 AddToModelState extension not to overwrite existing attempted values
* Added SetRulesetForClientsideMessages method for MVC5/AspNetCore as an alternative to using the RulesetForClientSideMessagesAttribute
			
Changes in 7.3:
* Major changes to AspNetCore integration including better support for collections and implicit validation (opt-in)
* Fix - Updated EnumValidator's Flags support to handle the ~0 value
* Fix - TestHelper checking for child validator would respond with the wrong type
* Fix - Updated translations for some validators
* Fix - Overload of WithName that takes a lambda generated an exception
* Added versions of WhenAsync and UnlessAsync that support CancellationTokens
* Simplify calls to DependentRules
* Add Skip property to CustomizeValidatorAttribute in the ASP.NET Core integration

Changes in 7.2:
* Updated AspNetCore integration to support IValidatableObject
* Updated AspNetCore integration to allow mixing multiple validation strategies in the same model
* Updated AspNetCore integration to support RulesetForClientsideMessagesAttribute
* Fix - Property names were not generated properly for nested types when using AddFailure inside a Custom validator
* Fix - NullReferenceException when using CustomAsync but the validator is invoked synchronously
* Fix - Clientside integration in AspNetCore being resolved from the root-level service provider
* Fix - Allow empty string to be passed to OverridePropertyName

Changes in 7.1.1:
* Fix - Incorrect property name was generated when using RuleForEach combined with SetValidator
* Fix - Nesting async validators inside DependentRules didn't wait for completion

Changes in 7.1:
* New RuleFor().Custom() method as a replacement for the old, deprecated Custom method
* Improved messages in the ShouldHaveChildValidator test extension
* Test helper works with nested properties
* Additional overload of WithState allows access to collection item when used with RuleForEach
* Fix - Wrong values were generated as part of the MVC5 clientside integration for MinLength and MaxLength validators
* Fix - AssemblyScanner now excludes abstract and generic types
* Fix - InvalidCastException when using lazy WithMessage combined with RuleForEach
* WithState enhanced to allow access to the ValidationContext

Changes in 7.0:

7.0 is a major release that contains several breaking changes, especially with Localization. If you use FluentValidation's support for localization please read the updated documentation: https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/wiki/f.-Localization

* Localization rewrite to not require satellite assemblies
* New 'Custom' rule method replaces the root-level Custom method
* Switch to Netstandard based build process
* Assemblies are now signed / strongly named - see https://github.com/JeremySkinner/FluentValidation/wiki/l.-Strong-naming-and-signed-packages
* Fix - Possible NullReferenceException in the AspNetCore clientside integration for length validators
* Fix - Don't clear the ModelValidatorProviders collection by default in the AspNetCore integration (added new ClearValidatorProviders property to control this behaviour)
* Fix - Ensure IValidatorFactory is resolved from request scope in asp.net core integration
* Fix - Property getter that throws an exception causes validation to fail in WebApi integration
* Fix - Issue in AspNetCore integration where we tried to resolve a collection validator in some situations where a class validator should be used
* Fix - Incorrect clientside validation attributes generated for email validator and credit card validator in the asp.net core integration
* Fix - Child model validation now works in webapi integration
* Improve splitting of PascalCased property names to support uppercase character sequences
* ValidationResult.ErrorCode property now always returns the type of the PropertyValidator that generated the message, unless it's been explicitly overriden
