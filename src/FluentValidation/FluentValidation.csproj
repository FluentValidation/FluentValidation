* Equal/NotEqual now perform ordinal comparison when used with string properties
* Severity can now be set dynamically with a callback

* ASP.NET Core: FluentValidationModelValidatorProvider and FluentValidationModelValidator are now public.
* Work around a bug in ASP.NET Core's integration testing components that can cause ConfigureServices to run multiple times.
* SourceLink integration.
* {CollectionIndex} placeholder can now be accessed in child validators.
* Additional ValidationException constructor that allows using both the default message and a custom one together.
