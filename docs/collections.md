# Collections

## Collections of Simple Types

You can use the `RuleForEach` method to apply the same rule to multiple items in a collection:

```csharp
public class Person {
  public List<string> AddressLines { get; set; } = new List<string>();
}
```

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
  public PersonValidator() {
    RuleForEach(x => x.AddressLines).NotNull();
  }
}
```

The above rule will run a NotNull check against each item in the `AddressLines` collection.

As of version 8.5, if you want to access the index of the collection element that caused the validation failure, you can use the special `{CollectionIndex}` placeholder:

```csharp
public class PersonValidator : AbstractValidator<Person> {
  public PersonValidator() {
    RuleForEach(x => x.AddressLines).NotNull().WithMessage("Address {CollectionIndex} is required.");
  }
}
```

## Collections of Complex Types

You can also combine `RuleForEach` with `SetValidator` when the collection is of another complex objects. For example:

```csharp
public class Customer {
  public List<Order> Orders { get; set; } = new List<Order>();
}

public class Order {
  public double Total { get; set; }
}
```

```csharp
public class OrderValidator : AbstractValidator<Order> {
  public OrderValidator() {
    RuleFor(x => x.Total).GreaterThan(0);
  }
}

public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> {
  public CustomerValidator() {
    RuleForEach(x => x.Orders).SetValidator(new OrderValidator());
  }
}
```

Alternatively, as of FluentValidation 8.5, you can also define rules for child collection elements in-line using the `ChildRules` method:

```csharp
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> {
  public CustomerValidator() {
    RuleForEach(x => x.Orders).ChildRules(orders => {
      orders.RuleFor(x => x.Total).GreaterThan(0);
    });
  }
}
```

You can optionally include or exclude certain items in the collection from being validated by using the `Where` method. Note this must come directly after the call to `RuleForEach`:

```csharp
RuleForEach(x => x.Orders)
  .Where(x => x.Cost != null)
  .SetValidator(new OrderValidator());
```

As of version 8.2, an alternative to using `RuleForEach` is to call `ForEach` as part of a regular `RuleFor`. With this approach you can combine rules that act upon the entire collection with rules which act upon individual elements within the collection. For example, imagine you have the following 2 rules:

```csharp
// This rule acts on the whole collection (using RuleFor)
RuleFor(x => x.Orders)
  .Must(x => x.Count <= 10).WithMessage("No more than 10 orders are allowed");

// This rule acts on each individual element (using RuleForEach)
RuleForEach(x => x.Orders)
  .Must(order => order.Total > 0).WithMessage("Orders must have a total of more than 0")
```

The above 2 rules could be re-written as:

```csharp
RuleFor(x => x.Orders)
  .Must(x => x.Count <= 10).WithMessage("No more than 10 orders are allowed")
  .ForEach(orderRule => {
    orderRule.Must(order => order.Total > 0).WithMessage("Orders must have a total of more than 0")
  });
```

I personally think that using 2 rules is clearer and easier to read, but the option of combining them is available with the `ForEach` method.
