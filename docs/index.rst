.. code-block:: c#

   public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer> {
     public CustomerValidator() {
       RuleFor(x => x.Surname).NotEmpty();
       RuleFor(x => x.Forename).NotEmpty().WithMessage("Please specify a first name");
       RuleFor(x => x.Discount).NotEqual(0).When(x => x.HasDiscount);
       RuleFor(x => x.Address).Length(20, 250);
       RuleFor(x => x.Postcode).Must(BeAValidPostcode).WithMessage("Please specify a valid postcode");
     }

     private bool BeAValidPostcode(string postcode) {
       // custom postcode validating logic goes here
     }
   }
