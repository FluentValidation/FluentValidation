# Blazor

FluentValidation does not provide integration with Blazor out of the box, but there are several third party libraries you can use to do this:

- [Blazored.FluentValidation](https://github.com/Blazored/FluentValidation)
- [Blazor-Validation](https://github.com/mrpmorris/blazor-validation)
- [Accelist.FluentValidation.Blazor](https://github.com/ryanelian/FluentValidation.Blazor)
