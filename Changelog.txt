* Updated ASP.NET MVC integration to MVC3 RC2

2.0 beta 2 - 9 November 2010
* Breaking change - Renamed the assembly names for SL/WP7 assemblies to FluentValidation.dll for consistency (formerly FluentValidation.Silverlight and FluentValidation.WP7)
* Breaking change - Finally removed the FV 1.1 backwards compatibility layer.
* Breaking chagne - Removed the deprecated Cascade() method - use Cascade(cascadeMode) instead (this was deprecated in 1.3)
* Provide more useful information in ValidationException error message.
* FluentValidatorModelMetadataProvider now converts NotNull/NotEmpty validators to IsRequired in metadata.
* Patch - updated German localization
* Using a child validator on a collection will now skip items in the collection that are null.
* NotEmptyValidator can now work against empty collections (must implement ICollection)

2.0 beta 1 - October 7 2010
* AttributedValidatorFactory is finally production worthy with the introduction of InstanceCache
* Fixed an issue where CascadeMode values are ignored if they're changed after the rules have been defined.
* Ported FluentValidation to WP7.
